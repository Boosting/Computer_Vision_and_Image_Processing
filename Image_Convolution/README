Description :
The project contains the program:  "convolve".
The "convolve" program performs convolution operation using a filter with the input image..
It uses OpenGL + GLUT to display the original and convoluted images.
It uses OpenIO for image read/write operations.

The code implements the basic requirements and extension.

Usage and Features:
1)Build the executables using Makefile.
Open a terminal and set the path to the project directory.
Use the commands: make clean;
				  make;
This will build the executables "convolve".

2)Convolution with external Filter file (Basic Requirement)
To perform convolution using the filter file
for a image,use the below command:

[Generic]:
./[exe] [input.png] [filter.filt]
./[exe] [input.png] [filter.filt] [optional out.png]

eg:
./convolve squares.png filter.filt
./convolve squares.png filter.filt squares_filter.png

Here,
	a)The program will display the input image input.png in a window and
		will store the kernel weights from the file filter.filt.

	b)To perform convolution and display the convoluted image press 'c' or 'C' via keyboard.

	c)To write the currently displayed image to a file,press 'w' or 'W'.
		If output file name is not specified in cmdline,the program will prompt the user for  the file name.

	d)Repeatedly pressing 'c' or 'C' will perform convolution repeatedly on the last convoluted image.

	e)Press 'esc' key to close the display and exit from the program.

3)Convolution with Gabor Filter(Extension)
To perform convolution using the Gabor filter use :

[Generic]:
./[exe] [input.png] [-g] [theta] [sigma] [period]
./[exe] [input.png] [-g] [theta] [sigma] [period][optional out.png]"

eg:
./convolve Lenna.png -g 0 4 4
./convolve Lenna.png -g 0 4 4 Lenna_gabor_044.png

Operations mentioned above in 2) can be used here too.

Notes/Issues:
1)Border of the convoluted image might vary from the convoluted image due to boundary condition handling.
Differnces varies with type of filter choosen but prevents constant balck border.
2)My two own kernels are named as "myown1.filt" and "myown2.filt"
