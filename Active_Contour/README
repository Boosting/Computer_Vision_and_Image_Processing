Active Contour Algorithm
Implemented an active contour algorithm based on criteriaâ€™s to achieve semi-automated method of segmentation.
Utilized Sobel filter to determine the edges of the objects in a image and used the concept of internal energy 
and external energy to move the initial contour to segment the objects in the image.
