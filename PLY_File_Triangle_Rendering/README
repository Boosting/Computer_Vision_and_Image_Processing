This project contains code to render triangles provided by a PLY file (ascii).
The program reads a PLY object filename and 3 rotation angles (degrees) as command line arguments.
It then sets the camera position using the 3 rotation angles and render a 256 x 256 pixel image
and saves it in PPM format.

The program uses roation matrices and ray-plan intersection to render the image using triangles.
