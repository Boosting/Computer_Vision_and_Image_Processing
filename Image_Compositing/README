Description :
The project contains two programs:  "alphamask" and "compose" to preform image compositing using green screening.
The "alphamask" program generates an alpha channel mask for image based upon its color info.
The "compose" program uses the alpha channel information of a foreground image and 
computes the over operator with the background image.It uses OpenGL + GLUT to display
the composite image and OpenIO for image read/write operations.

The code implements the basic requirements and extension.

Usage and Features:
1)Build the executables using Makefile.
Open a terminal and set the path to the project directory.
Use the commands: make clean;
				  make;
This will build the executables "alphamask" and "compose".

2)Masking (Basic Requirement)
To generate the alpha channel mask image("dhouse_fg.png")
for the image "dhouse.png",use the below command:

./alphamask dhouse.png dhouse_fg.png dhouse_config.txt

Here,dhouse_config.txt is a text file with the HSV ranges to perform the alpha masking.
[RANGE]:
Hue 100 150
Saturation 0.00 0.8
Value 0.2 0.8

To generate the alpha channel mask image("hand_fg.png")
for the image "hand.jpg",use the below command:

./alphamask hand.jpg hand_fg.png hand_config.txt

Here,hand_config.txt is a text file with the HSV ranges to perform the alpha masking.
[RANGE]:
Hue 55 150
Saturation 0.0 0.8
Value 0.2 0.8
 
Please note in the code, I have used an extended Hue range further to utilize full greyscale mask
for alpha.

3)Masking with Spill Suppression (Extension)
To enable Spill Suppression along with the alpha masking,use the flag -ss as a 
command line argument as shown below:

./alphamask dhouse.png dhouse_fg_ss.png dhouse_config.txt -ss
./alphamask hand.jpg hand_fg_ss.png hand_config.txt -ss

To implement Spill Suppression,I have utilize the scheme to adjust
the green channel as minimum of the three color channel (i.e. G = min(R,G,B)).

4)Compositing (Basic Requirement)
To generate and display the composite images using alphamasked foreground image and 
any background image,please us the below commands:

[To display in window and store result in output file]
./compose dhouse_fg_ss.png dhouse_bg.jpg dhouse_comp.png
./compose hand_fg_ss.png hand_bg.jpg hand_comp.png

[To just display in window]
./compose dhouse_fg_ss.png dhouse_bg.jpg
./compose hand_fg_ss.png hand_bg.jpg

User can also press the key 'w'/'W',to store the composite
image by specifying the filename when prompted.   

Notes/Issues:
1)All the resulting images are included in the project file for reference.
2)The program assumes that the foreground and background images have same dimensions in pixels.
