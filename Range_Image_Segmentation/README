Range Image Segmentation:
Implemented an algorithm to segment a range image based upon surface normals. 
The range image is threshold-ed and the pixels of the range image into 3D coordinates using which surface normals for the image are calculated.
Queue-based region growing is used to segment regions using Orientation of the normals as a predicate to join the region.
