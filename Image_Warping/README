Description :
The project contains the program:  "warper".
The "warper" program performs warping based on affine and projective warps.
It uses OpenGL + GLUT to display the warped image.
It uses OpenIO for image read/write operations.

The code implements the basic requirements and one extension.

Usage and Features:
1)Build the executables using Makefile.
Open a terminal and set the path to the project directory.
Use the commands: make clean;
				  make;
This will build the executables "warper".

2)Warping with perspective warp method (Basic Requirement)
To perform warping for a image,use the below command:

[Generic]:
./[exe] [input.png]
./[exe] [input.png][optional out.png]

eg:
./warper squares.png
./warper squares.png squares_warped.png

Here,

a)On execution the program will display a cmdline options to user to select the transfrom operations to be performed on the input image.

[cmdline display]:
enter 'n' for twirl warp; 'r' for rotate; 's' for scaling;
't' for translation;'h' for shear; 'f' for flipping; 'p' for perspective warp options; 'd' for done
>

b)For basic requirement the user can select the the combination of all the trasform options except 'n' for twirl warp.

c)When the user has finished selecting the desired transfrom operations,he should indicate it by entering 'd'.
On selecting 'd' the program will display the warped image in a window.
If the optional output filename was specified ,it will store the warped image into a  file. 

c)Press 'esc' key to close the display and exit from the program.

3)Support a twirl warp(Extension)

To perform twirl warp use :

eg:
./warper squares.png
./warper squares.png squares_warped.png

Here,
a)On execution the program will display a cmdline options to user to select the transfrom operations to be performed on the input image.

[cmdline display]:
enter 'n' for twirl warp; 'r' for rotate; 's' for scaling;
't' for translation;'h' for shear; 'f' for flipping; 'p' for perspective warp options; 'd' for done
>

The user should select 'n' to enter into twirl warp mode and press 'd'.
Then the user should enter the factors to determine the the center location for twirl to start
and the strength of the twirl.

eg:
> n
twirl warp selected;press d next
> d
Twirl Mode - enter factors :
Center factor cx
0.5
Center factor cy
0.5
strength factor s
7.5

Notes/Issues:
1)The implementation assumes the bottom left corner of the image as the origin.
The no pixel is mapped in the output image to the input image then it will be set to white.

2)If you need to observe the final forward map matrix and inverse map matrix,
please enable the macro #undef DEBUG_MODE in the file manager.h
